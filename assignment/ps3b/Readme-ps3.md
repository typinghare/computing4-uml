## Description

Sokoban is a puzzle video game in which the player pushes boxes around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations. This program offers a straightforward rendition of the Sokoban game, known for its pixel-style design. The game world comprises numerous tiles, each measuring 64x64 pixels.



Upon startup, the program reads a designated level file (`.lvl`) to initialize the game map. Players navigate the character using either the "WASD" keys or the arrow keys, moving one tile per keypress. However, certain scenarios may block the player, halting their movement. Victory entails pushing all boxes to designated storage locations. When all boxes occupy storage spaces, or all storage spaces accommodate boxes, the player emerges triumphant.
