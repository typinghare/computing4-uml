In the blockbuster film "The Wandering Earth," humanity faces an unprecedented crisis as the
impending explosion of the sun threatens all life on Earth. In a desperate bid for survival,
scientists devise an audacious plan: to physically relocate the entire planet out of harm's way.
Harnessing the immense gravitational pull of Jupiter, they plot a daring trajectory that utilizes
the gas giant's gravitational force as a slingshot, propelling Earth on a monumental journey through
the cosmos. This ambitious strategy not only conserves precious energy but also imparts the
necessary kinetic boost to alter Earth's trajectory, steering it away from the sun's catastrophic
fate. As mankind's fate hangs in the balance, the stage is set for an epic interstellar adventure
unlike any other.

In this simulation, Jupiter stands as the fixed anchor at the center of the universe, while Earth
sets its course towards the gas giant. As Earth draws near to Jupiter, it undergoes a dynamic
sequence of events: initially accelerating under the gravitational influence, then curving its
trajectory as it bends towards the colossal presence of Jupiter, before gradually decelerating as it
ventures away from its gravitational grasp. This intricate dance of forces illustrates the profound
interplay between celestial bodies, shaping the paths they traverse through the vast expanse of
space.
